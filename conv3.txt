Therapist:
 So you are telling me, that no one wants to be your friend because you are a loser?
Client:
 Yes, that's what I've been telling you! I came to you because I don't want to be a loser anymore. Iwant to be like the popular kids, who walks around the school hallways, always smiling and have manyfriends! Well, a loser like me will never be like that.
Therapist:
 I see. Can you tell me what a loser is?
Client:
 A loser is someone who has no friends because you like computers, cartoons, and math. A loseris someone who is always at the top of the class, people are connecting it immediately to being "grade-conscious". A loser is someone who likes to play computer games, likes to read books, and listens toclassical music. In short, a loser is like me!
Therapist:
 So you are saying that you like to play computer games, you like math, you like to read books,you love to listen to classical music, you like to watch cartoons, and you are always at the top of theclass, and you are a loser? Am I right?
Client:
 Yes. You're right. That's why nobody wants to be my friend.
Therapist:
 Don't you think that being at the top of the class, loving to read books, and being good atcomputers and math, are gifts? I mean, it's a talent. Not many people have those kinds of characteristics.
Client:
 Yeah. Well, maybe. But that doesn't change anything.
Therapist:
 Yes it does. I think it's not a thing losers have. Do you really think that those talents are notgifts? I mean, those talents only bring worse to your life?
Client:
 Well, I don't know. Maybe.. Maybe not.. But if those things are actually good, then why don't Ihave many friends?
Therapist:
 Can you think of another reason? Because you know, Jenny, being at the top of the class is agood thing. You mentioned that you don't have a hard time studying for your exams, and you don'tstudy that often. But you are still at the top. Don't you think that it is an achievement?
Client:
 Yes. I do think it is an achievement. I can see some of my classmates having a hard time studyingfor the exams, but I can still surpass them. When I'm at school, I am always reading novels. I seldomread my textbooks. But I can still do better than them.
Therapist:
 Do they talk to you sometimes?
Client:
 Now that you mentioned it, yes, they do talk to me.
Therapist:
 Then why do you think they don't like you, if they do talk to you?
 Client:
 I don't know. I can just feel that they don't like me.
Therapist:
 Don't you think that they want to be your friend, but because you are always reading books,like you mentioned earlier, they just don't want to disturb you?[10-15 seconds silence]
Client:
Maybe..
Therapist:
You see Jenny, you are not a loser. You are a talented young woman, who has a variety ofinterests, well, special interests that few people like too. You are smart, and you are special.
Client:
You think so?
Therapist:
Yes. As I understand your story, I think they wanted you to be their friend, but you are toobusy to notice them.
Client:
Now that you said it, I think that’s the way it is now. I am not a loser, and I am just too busy to t
ry
and notice them. Then I thought they don’t like me, but they actually do.
 
Therapist:
So, what will you do tomorrow when you go to class?
Client:
I’ll try to talk to them. Maybe they will talk to me tomorrow if I am not reading. I’ll read on my
free time
, but I’ll try to interact with them. I’ll try to be like a friend.
 
Therapist:
Really? You will do that?
Client:
Yes, I think I can do that. Thank you, doc. Thank you for helping me solve my problem.
Therapist:
Well, don’t mention it. See you next week. I
hope things will work out just fine for you.
